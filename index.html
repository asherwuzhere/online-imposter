    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>
      1. One player creates a lobby and shares the code. Everyone else joins with that code.<br>
      2. The host starts the game once there are at least 3 players.<br>
      3. Each player gets a question. One random player is the Imposter and gets a slightly different question.<br>
      4. Everyone types their answer secretly. Once all are ready, everyone's answers are revealed.<br>
      5. Then the main question is revealed. Only the host's browser will read it aloud; everyone sees it on screen.<br>
      6. Vote on who you think the Imposter is. The results will show who was voted out, and if they were the Imposter.<br>
      7. Have fun deducing who is lying!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Answers are typed privately. The Imposter tries to blend in by giving an answer that fits the main question they <em>did not</em> actually see.
